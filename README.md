# JavaEE: Angular2 Architype
The easiest way to get started with JavaEE + Angular2!

If you are like us and love Angular2 because it's kind of the **"EE of Javascript"** you will like this Maven Architype :simple_smile: .

What does it contain:
- Multi Module Maven Project (separation of concerns)
- API Example for JavaEE
- Website Example for Angular2
- Ready to deploy with maven (Automatic angular Production Builds with every Maven Build)
- Develop with angular-cli, npm and node.js but use run without it in production (Standard JavaEE Container Wildfly, Glassfish,...)

How To use:
```sh
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=io.coodoo:JavaEE7-Angular2-Architype
```
